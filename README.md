# IDS/IPS Deployment Lab

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on deploying and configuring Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) using Snort and Suricata for real-time threat detection.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Snort
- Suricata
- Kali Linux
- Windows VM
- Wireshark

## ⚙️ Implementation Steps
1. Installed Snort and Suricata on Linux-based systems.
2. Generated network traffic using simulated attacks (Nmap, Metasploit).
3. Captured and analyzed logs using Kibana.
4. Tuned rule sets to reduce false positives.
5. Evaluated performance by comparing detection rates.


## ✅ Key Learnings
- Configured IDS/IPS tools from scratch.
- Monitored and analyzed network traffic for signs of intrusion.
- Understood rule writing and tuning in a real-world lab setup.
